# Learning analytics methods and tutorials: A practical guide using R

This repository contains the companion data for the book **“Learning analytics methods and tutorials: A practical guide using R”** which will be published by Springer in 2024. A pre-print web version of the book can be seen at [https://lamethods.github.io](https://lamethods.github.io). The book aims to provide a methodological guide for researchers to study, consult, and embark upon the first steps toward innovation in the learning analytics field. Thanks to the unique wealth of authors’ backgrounds and expertise, which include authors of R packages and experts in methods and applications, the book offers a comprehensive array of methods that are described thoroughly with a primer on their usage in prior research in education. These methods include sequence analysis, Markov models, factor analysis, process mining, network analysis, predictive modeling, and cluster analysis among others. A step-by-step tutorial using the R programming language with real-life datasets and case studies is presented for each method. In addition, the initial chapters are devoted to getting novice researchers up to speed with the R programming learners and the basics of data analysis.
